ONE NETWORK STRUCTURE TRAINED ON TWO DATASETS

This is a course project for exploring something interesting in deep neural
networks.  The course is hold by Prof. Hopcroft in Jan. 2018.

The problem setting is: Consider two data sets of letters with the same set of
letters but no common images.  If you train a network twice, once with each 
set of images, do the network gates learn the same things?  If you train with
one set of images and test with the other how well does the testing do?
